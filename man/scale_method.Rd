\title{Dimensional reduction based on 0-1 scaling.}
\usage{
scale_method(data_input, focus = "group")
}
\arguments{
\item{data_input}{Counts data, sample information, and biological process list uploaded using import_data()}
}
\value{
A list with:
\itemize{
\item projection: data frame with sample, normalised_distance, category, furthest_groups.
\item information: data frame with number of features per category.
}
}
\description{
To be used as part of dim_reduction().
}
\details{
For each biological category, computes average expression per sample,
normalizes to 0-1 range across samples,
calculates mean normalized counts per group,
identifies furthest groups by min and max mean counts,
returns per-sample values and metadata in PCA-like output format.
