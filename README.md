# RadarOmics

RadarOmics is an R package for summarising 'omics datasets using dimensional reduction techniques and visualising the output across samples, treatments, and biological processes using radar plots. It is designed to handle complex experimental set-ups with >2 treatments, and can handle nested experimental design (e.g., multiple developmental stages and chemical exposure treatments). It works with gene or protein expression tables (or similar tabular datasets).
