Version: 0.1.0

Description: Use dimensional reduction techniques (scaling, PCA, LDA) to summarise expression profiles across large numbers of samples and treatments for targeted biological processes. Isolate values representing expression profiles and visualise with radar plots. Supports input from normalised gene expression tables or other datasets with similar structures (e.g., gene/protein as rows, samples as columns).
